    <h2>Welcome to Showcase! ✨ </h2>

    <p>
    Here I will share some moments outside of research —
    </p>
    <p>
    - 🐱 Adorable cats that keep me company during long hours of coding and writing. 
    </p>
    <p>
    - 🌄 Beautiful sceneries I’ve come across during travels and daily life. 
    </p>
    <p>
    - 🎨 Occasional creative works and snapshots that inspire me.
    </p>
    <p>
    This space is meant to be a lighthearted corner of my homepage, reminding me (and hopefully you too!) of the small joys beyond academia. 💫
