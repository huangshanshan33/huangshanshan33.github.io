    I received my PhD in Software Engineering from Chongqing University in 2025, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DfxieQEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank">Prof. Li Liu</a>. Before that, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering at Yunnan University in 2021, guided by Prof. Xinjie Li and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PCSvIh8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank">Associate Prof. Xin Jin</a>. Moreover, I am supported by the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by the CAST-Doctoral Student Special Plan (via CCF).
